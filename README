
Morfologik
==========

This project provides:

  - Creation of byte-based, efficient finite state automata in Java, including
    custom, efficient data storage formats.

  - Compatibility with FSA5, binary format of finite state automata produced by
    Jan Daciuk's "fsa" package.

  - A lemmatization engine for the Polish language built on top of a 
    large dictionary of inflected forms, stems and grammatical annotations.


There are a few command-line tools you may find useful. Type:

  java -jar morfologik-stemming-${version}.jar

for an up-to-date list of all tools.
