
PLANS FOR VERSION 1.2

- Add a set of utility classes for parsing morphological tags. This could be similar 
  (or even compatible?) with Morfeusz-Java.

- Suggest and implement a new stemming heuristic based on inflection frames.


Performance notes:

Original (intermediate byte [] construction):

FSA traversal        -> Rounds: 20, Time: 6.451, Time/round: 0.323, Sequences/sec.: 155014
Stemming performance -> Rounds: 20, Time: 4.405, Time/round: 0.220, Sequences/sec.: 227014

Reusable ByteBuffer 

FSA traversal        -> Rounds: 20, Time: 5.811, Time/round: 0.291, Sequences/sec.: 172087
Stemming performance -> Rounds: 20, Time: 4.405, Time/round: 0.220, Sequences/sec.: 227014

Switching to int representation for arcs and nodes. This reduces code clarity, but boosts
performance twice. Itt's worth it. Not many people will use FSA directly and if they do,
they probably can live with int pointers.

FSA traversal        -> Rounds: 20, Time: 2.530, Time/round: 0.127, Sequences/sec.: 395256
Stemming performance -> Rounds: 20, Time: 2.625, Time/round: 0.131, Sequences/sec.: 380952

Changing stemming API to return reusable objects.

FSA traversal        -> Rounds: 20, Time: 2.546, Time/round: 0.127, Sequences/sec.: 392772
Stemming performance -> Rounds: 20, Time: 3.250, Time/round: 0.163, Sequences/sec.: 307692
