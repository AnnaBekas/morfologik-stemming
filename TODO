
PLANS FOR VERSION 1.2

- Add a set of utility classes for parsing morphological tags. This could be similar 
  (or even compatible?) with Morfeusz-Java.

- Suggest and implement a new stemming heuristic based on inflection frames.

- Check and verify tools.

- Add the possibility to dump decoded (expanded) dictionaries.
