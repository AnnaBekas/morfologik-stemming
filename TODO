
PLANS FOR VERSION 1.3

- Remove in-memory buffering (via DataInput); simply use InputStream/OutputStream.

- Refactor CFSAEncoder into FSA5 node/arc representation and re-encoder. Take into account
possible gtl expansions if offsets change.

PLANS FOR VERSION 1.4

- Add a set of utility classes for parsing morphological tags. This could be similar 
  (or even compatible?) with Morfeusz-Java.

- Suggest and implement a new stemming heuristic based on inflection frames.
