PLANS FOR VERSION 1.4

- Add arc reuse (optimisation).

- Modify automaton structure to allow binary search on highly fanning nodes. Measure perf. gain. 

- Add a set of utility classes for parsing morphological tags. This could be similar 
  (or even compatible?) with Morfeusz-Java.

- Suggest and implement a new stemming heuristic based on inflection frames.
