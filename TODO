NEXT MAJOR VERSION

- New binary automaton format;
  - allow direct arc lookup on highly fanning nodes, especially root nodes
  - allow direct perf. hashing number on arcs of highly fanning nodes, especially root nodes
  - variable coding for state numbers
  - state flags to encode single-arc-final tails in a compact form (no arcs at all?).

- fsa_build should serialize to FSA5 or CFSA, depending on a switch. 


NOT EVEN SCHEDULED

- Add arc reuse (optimisation).

- Add a set of utility classes for parsing morphological tags. This could be similar 
  (or even compatible?) with Morfeusz-Java.

- Suggest and implement a new stemming heuristic based on inflection frames.
