
PLANS FOR VERSION 1.2

- Add a performance test for FSA traversal using the API. Check what is the stemmer's bottleneck
  (memory allocation?). 

- Add a set of utility classes for parsing morphological tags. This could be similar 
  (or even compatible?) with Morfeusz-Java.

- Suggest and implement a new stemming heuristic based on inflection frames.
