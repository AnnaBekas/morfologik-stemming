
PLANS FOR VERSION 1.4

- Add a command-line tool for building FSA5 automata from input files (similar to fsa_build).

- Perhaps try to add minimization with accepting flag on transitions (so that the resulting
automaton is identical in size with Janek's).

- Modify automaton structure to allow binary search on highly fanning nodes. Measure perf.
gain. 

- Add a set of utility classes for parsing morphological tags. This could be similar 
  (or even compatible?) with Morfeusz-Java.

- Suggest and implement a new stemming heuristic based on inflection frames.
