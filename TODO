
PLANS FOR VERSION 1.2

- Add a set of utility classes for parsing morphological tags. This could be similar 
  (or even compatible?) with Morfeusz-Java.

- Suggest and implement a new stemming heuristic based on inflection frames.

- There are some 1.6 API calls. Should we backport them to support Java 1.5? I guess it
  would be sensible, since there is a relatively small number of such calls.
