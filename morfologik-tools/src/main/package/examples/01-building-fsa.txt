# This example constructs a finite state automaton (FSA) out
# of byte sequences in the input file:
#
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine
#
# Each sequence is encoded as one path in the automaton. Input are LF-separated 
# byte sequences.

# This is a low-level API, typically you'll want to compile a 
# dictionary, not a raw automaton.
