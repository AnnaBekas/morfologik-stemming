1.1       Introduced an auxiliary "meta" information files about compressed dictionaries.
          Such information include delimeter symbol, encoding and infix/prefix/postfix
          decoding info.
          
          The API has changed (repackaging). Some deprecated methods have been removed.
          This is a major redesign/ upgrade, you will have to adjust your source code.

1.0.6     Customized version of stempel replaced with a standard distribution.

          * A major bug in automaton traversal corrected. Upgrade when possible.
          
          Certain API changes were introduced; older methods are now deprecated
          and will be removed in the future.

1.0.4     Licenses for full and no-dict versions.

1.0.3     Project code moved to SourceForge (subproject of Morfologik).
          LICENSE CHANGED FROM PUBLIC DOMAIN TO BSD (doesn't change much, but clarifies
          legal issues).

1.0.2     Added a Lametyzator constructor which allows custom dictionary stream, field
          delimiters and encoding. Added an option for building stand-alone 
          JAR that does not include the default polish dictionary.
