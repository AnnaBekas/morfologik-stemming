
PLANS FOR VERSION 1.2

- Clean up package structure (flatten unnecessary packages).

- Add a performance test for FSA traversal using the API. Check what is the stemmer's bottleneck
  (memory allocation?). 

- Rename stemmer classes to match the project's name. I suggest making a single class
  MorfologikStemmer and add a property that would determine whether fallback heuristic
  is used for missing dictionary words.

  public class MorfologikStemmer {
    public void setUseDictionary(boolean flag);
    public void setUseHeuristic(boolean flag);
    ...
  }

- Add a set of utility classes for parsing morphological tags. This could be similar 
  (or even compatible?) with Morfeusz-Java.

- Suggest and implement a new stemming heuristic based on inflection frames.

- Compile for java 1.5 and make it a requirement.
